 abstract = {It is shown that the least squares approach to reconciling hierarchical time series forecasts can be extended to much more general collections of time series with aggregation constraints. The constraints arise due to the need for forecasts of collections of time series to add up in the same way as the observed time series. It is also shown that the computations involved can be handled efficiently by exploiting the structure of the associated design matrix, or by using sparse matrix routines. The proposed algorithms make forecast reconciliation feasible in business applications involving very large numbers of time series.

By analyzing the aggregation method of the available data, it results that their adequate model of representation is the one of the hierarchical time series. The pyramidal, hierarchical relation between components of the series results in a high degree of correlation between the series and therefore the forecast of these particular instances of multiple time series requires adequate treatment.

To address this issue, we consider reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates, extending the methods of Hyndman et al. in 2011 to functional time series, where age is considered as a continuum. The grouped functional time series methods are used to produce point forecasts of mortality rates that are aggregated appropriately across different disaggregation factors.

The first section is dedicated to the industrial context and a review of individual electrical data analysis. Then, we focus on hierarchical time-series for bottom-up forecasting.

 abstract = {Abstract Time series forecasting plays an important role in many decision support systems, also in those related to the management of supply chains. Forecast accuracy is, therefore, essential to optimise the efficiency of any supply chain. One aspect that is often overlooked is the fact that sales of many products within an organization are assembled as complex hierarchies with different levels of aggregation. Very often forecasts are produced regardless of such structure, though forecasting accuracy may be improved by taking it into account. In this paper, an approach for hierarchical time series forecasting based on State Space modelling is proposed. Previous developments provide solutions to the hierarchical forecasting problem by algebra manipulations based on forecasts produced by independent models for each time series involved in the hierarchy.

Mortality modeling and forecasting have therefore attracted increasing attention from various areas, such as the public pension systems, commercial insurance sectors, as well as actuarial, demographic and epidemiological research. Compared to the aggregate mortality experience, cause-specific mortality rates contain more detailed information, and can help us better understand the ongoing mortality improvements. However, when conducting cause-of-death mortality modeling, it is important to ensure coherence in the forecasts. That is, the forecasts of cause-specific mortality rates should add up to the forecasts of the aggregate mortality rates.

Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent. The reconciliation algorithm proposed by Hyndman et al.

 abstract = {• A novel strategy hierarchical time series forecasting is proposed. • Support Vector Regression is adapted for dealing with hierarchical time series. • The proposal is successfully applied in a case study in sales forecasting. • Best predictive performance is achieved in experiments on benchmark datasets. Times series often offers a natural disaggregation in a hierarchical structure. For example, product sales can come from different cities, districts, or states; or be grouped by categories and subcategories. This hierarchical structure can be useful for improving the forecast, and this strategy is known as hierarchical time series (HTS) analysis. In this work, a novel strategy for sales forecasting is proposed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and hierarchical time series. We formalize three different hierarchical time series approaches: bottom-up SVR, top-down SVR, and middle-out SVR, and use them in a sales forecasting project for the Travel Retail Industry.

 abstract = {In recent decades, there has been significant growth in the capital market for mortality- and longevity-linked bonds. Therefore, modeling and forecasting the mortality indexes underlying these bonds have crucial implications for risk management in life insurance companies. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical reconciliation approach to constructing probabilistic forecasts for mortality bond indexes. We apply this approach to analyzing the Swiss Re Kortis bond, which is the first "longevity trend bond" introduced in the market. We express the longevity divergence index associated with the bond's principal reduction factor (PRF) in a hierarchical setting. We first adopt time-series models to obtain forecasts on each hierarchical level, and then apply a minimum trace reconciliation approach to ensure coherence of forecasts across all levels. Based on the reconciled probabilistic forecasts of the longevity divergence index, we estimate the probability distribution of the PRF of the Ko)},

The 2017 Global Energy Forecasting Competition (GEFCom2017) focused on addressing this topic. Quantile forecasts for eight zones and two aggregated zones in New England were required for every hour of a future month. This paper presents a new methodology for forecasting quantiles in a hierarchy which outperforms a commonly-used benchmark model. A simulation-based approach was used to generate demand forecasts. Adjustments were made to each of the demand simulations to ensure that all zonal forecasts reconciled appropriately, and a weighted reconciliation approach was implemented to ensure that the bottom-level zonal forecasts summed correctly to the aggregated zonal forecasts. We show that reconciling in this manner improves the forecast accuracy. A discussion of the results and modelling performances is presented, and brief reviews of hierarchical time s)},

One of the critical factors that affect the performance of the two methods is the correlation between the data series. This study attempts to resolve the problem and shows that the top-down method performs better when data have high positive correlation compared to high negative correlation and combination of forecasting methods may be the best solution when there is no evidence of the correlationship. We conduct the computational experiments using 240 monthly data series from the 'Industrial' category of the M3-Competition and test twelve combination methods for the hierarchical data series.

This has motivated recent developments in forecasting functional time series in a group structure, where static principal component analysis is used. In the presence of moderate to strong temporal dependence, static principal component analysis designed for independent and identically distributed functional data may be inadequate. Thus, through using the dynamic functional principal component analysis, we consider a functional time series forecasting method with static and dynamic principal component regression to forecast each series in a group structure.

The forecasts are based on individual seasonal time series models that consider both, deterministic and stochastic seasonality, and on disaggregated Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. After selecting the best forecasting model for each index, we compare the individual forecasts to forecasts produced using two methods that aggregate hierarchical time series, the bottom-up method and an optimal combination approach. Applying these techniques to 16 indices of the Mexican CPI, we find that the best forecasts for headline inflation are able to compete with those taken from surveys of experts.

We call these “hierarchical time series”. They are commonly forecast using either a “bottom-up” or a “top-down” method. In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Our method is based on independently forecasting all series at all levels of the hierarchy and then using a regression model to optimally combine and reconcile these forecasts. The resulting revised forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy, are unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all combination forecasts under some simple assumptions. We show in a simulation study that our method performs well compared to the top-down approach and the bottom-up method. We dem)},
