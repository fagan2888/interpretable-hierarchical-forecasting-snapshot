Quantile forecasts for eight zones and two aggregated zones in New England were required for every hour of a future month. This paper presents a new methodology for forecasting quantiles in a hierarchy which outperforms a commonly-used benchmark model. A simulation-based approach was used to generate demand forecasts. Adjustments were made to each of the demand simulations to ensure that all zonal forecasts reconciled appropriately, and a weighted reconciliation approach was implemented to ensure that the bottom-level zonal forecasts summed correctly to the aggregated zonal forecasts. We show that reconciling in this manner improves the forecast accuracy. A discussion of the results and modelling performances is presented, and brief reviews of hierarchical time s)",article,13879461320191001,4

One of the critical factors that affect the performance of the two methods is the correlation between the data series. This study attempts to resolve the problem and shows that the top-down method performs better when data have high positive correlation compared to high negative correlation and combination of forecasting methods may be the best solution when there is no evidence of the correlationship. We conduct the computational experiments using 240 monthly data series from the 'Industrial' category of the M3-Competition and test twelve combination methods for the hierarchical data series. The results show that the regression-based, VAR-COV and the Rank-based methods perform better compared to the other methods.

This has motivated recent developments in forecasting functional time series in a group structure, where static principal component analysis is used. In the presence of moderate to strong temporal dependence, static principal component analysis designed for independent and identically distributed functional data may be inadequate. Thus, through using the dynamic functional principal component analysis, we consider a functional time series forecasting method with static and dynamic principal component regression to forecast each series in a group structure.

The forecasts are based on individual seasonal time series models that consider both, deterministic and stochastic seasonality, and on disaggregated Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. After selecting the best forecasting model for each index, we compare the individual forecasts to forecasts produced using two methods that aggregate hierarchical time series, the bottom-up method and an optimal combination approach. Applying these techniques to 16 indices of the Mexican CPI, we find that the best forecasts for headline inflation are able to compete with those taken from surveys of experts.

We call these âhierarchical time seriesâ. They are commonly forecast using either a âbottom-upâ or a âtop-downâ method. In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Our method is based on independently forecasting all series at all levels of the hierarchy and then using a regression model to optimally combine and reconcile these forecasts. The resulting revised forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy, are unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all combination forecasts under some simple assumptions. We show in a simulation study that our method performs well compared to the top-down approach and the bottom-up method. We dem)",article,6066167820110901,9
