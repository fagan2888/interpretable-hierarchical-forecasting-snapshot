 abstract = {{In many applications, there are multiple time series that are
hierarchically organized and can be aggregated at several different
levels in groups based on products, geography or some other features. We
call these ``hierarchical time series{''}. They are commonly forecast
using either a ``bottom-up{''} or a ``top-down{''} method.
In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting
which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced
by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Our method is based on
independently forecasting all series at all levels of the hierarchy and
then using a regression model to optimally combine and reconcile these
forecasts. The resulting revised forecasts add up appropriately across
the hierarchy, are unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all
combination forecasts under some simple assumptions.
We show in a simulation study that our method performs well compared to
the top-down approach and the bottom-up method. We demonstrate our
proposed method by forecasting Australian tourism demand where the data
are disaggregated by purpose of travel and geographical region. (C) 2011

 abstract = {{. Smoothing of observed measures of healthcare provider performance is
well known to lead to advantages in terms of predictive ability.
However, with routinely collected longitudinal data there is the
opportunity to smooth either between units, across time or both.
Hierarchical generalized linear models with time as a covariate and
hierarchical time series models each result in such two-way or
bidirectional smoothing. These models are increasingly being suggested
in the literature, but their advantages relative to simpler alternatives
have not been systematically investigated. With reference to two topical
examples of performance data sets in the UK, we compare a range of
models on the basis of their short-term predictive ability. Rather than
focusing on point predictive accuracy alone, fully probabilistic
comparisons are made, using proper scoring rules and tests for
uniformity of predictive p-values. Hierarchical generalized linear
models with time as a covariate were found to perform poorly for both
data sets. In contrast, a hierarchical time series model with a latent
AR(1) structure has attractive properties and was found to perform well.
Of concern, however, is the large amount of time that is needed to fit
this model using the WinBUGS software. We suggest that research into
simpler and faster methods to fit models of a similar structure would be
of much benefit.}},

one- to ten-step-ahead point and interval forecast accuracies between
the independent and grouped functional time series forecasting methods.
The proposed methods are shown to be useful for reconciling forecasts of

@article{ISI:000400533000029,
 abstract = {{To integrate solar energy into the electricity grid reliably and
efficiently, different forecasting techniques are used to produce
forecasts at various forecast horizons using data of different levels of
aggregation. For example, power generated by distributed photovoltaics
(PV) can be disaggregated in a geographical hierarchy into transmission
zones, distribution nodes, PV plants, subsystems and inverters;
forecasts are required at all of these levels to facilitate different
power system operations and power plant management. Due to the different
information sets visible to different players in the hierarchy, such as
PV plant owners and independent system operators, the forecasts produced
at different aggregation levels are often not optimal. Furthermore,
these forecasts are aggregate inconsistent, i.e., forecasts made using
data collected at lower levels do not add up exactly to the forecasts
made using higher level data.
In this paper, the state-of-the-art forecast reconciliation techniques
are explored. By minimizing the trace of forecast error covariance
matrix, the base forecasts obtained across the hierarchy can be
optimally reconciled. The reconciled forecasts not only aggregate
consistently, and thus lead to collaborative decision making, but also
improve the base forecasts at each level significantly. The merit of the
reconciliation framework goes to the fact that it does not require any
additional information other than those base forecasts. Furthermore,
forecast improvements are independent of the base forecasting methods.
In other words, once the base forecasts are generated with our favorite
methods, the reconciliation will most likely improve those forecasts
further.
The reconciliation techniques can be applied to a variety of hierarchies
with different forecast horizons. The empirical part of this work
considers two examples, namely, an NWP-based day-ahead forecast
reconciliation over 318 simulated PV plants in the state of California,
and a spatio-temporal statistical 1 min-ahead forecast reconciliation
over 17 irradiance sensors on the Oahu Island, Hawaii. It is shown that
reconciliation benefits both the gird operators and PV system owners by
bringing more accurate forecasts, and thus motivates information sharing
in an electricity grid. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

 abstract = {{Age -specific mortality rates are often disaggregated by different
attributes, such as sex, state, ethnic group and socioeconomic status.
In making social policies and pricing annuity at national and
subnational levels, it is important not only to forecast mortality
accurately, but also to ensure that forecasts at the subnational level
add up to the forecasts at the national level. This motivates recent
developments in grouped functional time series methods (Shang and
Hyndman, in press) to reconcile age-specific mortality forecasts. We
extend these grouped functional time series forecasting methods to
multivariate time series, and apply them to produce point forecasts of
mortality rates at older ages, from which fixed-term annuities for
different ages and maturities can be priced. Using the regional
age-specific mortality rates in Japan obtained from the Japanese
Mortality Database, we investigate the one-step-ahead to 15-step ahead
point-forecast accuracy between the independent and grouped forecasting
methods. The grouped forecasting methods are shown not only to be useful
for reconciling forecasts of age -specific mortality rates at national
and subnational levels, but they are also shown to allow improved
forecast accuracy. The improved forecast accuracy of mortality rates is
of great interest to the insurance and pension industries for estimating

 abstract = {{Previously in ``Reconciling solar forecasts: Geographical hierarchy{''}
{[}Solar Energy 146 (2017) 276-286], we have demonstrated that by
reconciling the forecasts obtained from a geographical hierarchy (formed
by levels such as transmission zones, distribution nodes, PV plants,
subsystems and inverters), more accurate forecasts can be obtained as
compared to forecasts produced using only the information from a single
level. Furthermore, these reconciled forecasts are aggregate consistent,
facilitating different power system operations and power plant
management. In this paper, we continue our discussion on hierarchical
reconciliation and consider another type of hierarchy, namely, temporal
hierarchy.
A temporal hierarchy can be constructed by aggregating a high-frequency
time series (e.g., hourly) into different low-frequency time series
(e.g., 6-hourly and daily). While the measurements in a temporal
hierarchy sum up consistently (e.g., the first two points in an hourly
time series sum up to be the first point in the 2-hourly time series),
the forecasts in general do not stun up, due to the different models
used to generate forecasts. This inconsistency poses an apparent problem
when selecting forecasts, Using reconciliation could mitigate the
problem by reconciling different forecasts obtained at different
timescales, and thus generating aggregate consistent forecasts. In
addition, the reconciled forecasts reduce modeling uncertainties using
combinations similar to the ensemble forecasting used in numerical
weather prediction (NWP) and thus improve forecast accuracy.
The empirical part of the paper consists an NWP-based day-ahead forecast
reconciliation example. Hourly data from 318 sites in California, over a
period of 1 year, is used. Over 50 million forecasts are produced in
this paper, in an operational forecasting context. Temporal
reconciliation is shown to significantly outperform NWP forecasts
produced by 3TIER, with a forecast skill (computed based on 3TIER
forecasts) up to 0.3. Since reconciliation does not require any
additional information, such improvement is thus encouraging.}},

clustering tools for bottom-up short-term load forecasting. We focus on
individual consumption data analysis which plays a major role for energy
management and electricity load forecasting. The first section is
dedicated to the industrial context and a review of individual
electrical data analysis. Then, we focus on hierarchical time-series for
bottom-up forecasting. The idea is to decompose the global signal and
obtain disaggregated forecasts in such a way that their sum enhances the
prediction. This is done in three steps: identify a rather large number
of super-consumers by clustering their energy profiles, generate a
hierarchy of nested partitions and choose the one that minimize a
prediction criterion. Using a nonparametric model to handle forecasting,
and wavelets to define various notions of similarity between load
curves, this disaggregation strategy gives a 16\% improvement in
forecasting accuracy when applied to French individual consumers. Then,
this strategy is implemented using R-the free software environment for
statistical computing-so that it can scale when dealing with massive
datasets. The proposed solution is to make the algorithm scalable
combine data storage, parallel computing and double clustering step to
define the super-consumers. The resulting software is openly available.}},

 abstract = {{Time series forecasting plays an important role in many decision support
systems, also in those related to the management of supply chains.
Forecast accuracy is, therefore, essential to optimise the efficiency of
any supply chain. One aspect that is often overlooked is the fact that
sales of many products within an organization are assembled as complex
hierarchies with different levels of aggregation. Very often forecasts
are produced regardless of such structure, though forecasting accuracy
may be improved by taking it into account. In this paper, an approach
for hierarchical time series forecasting based on State Space modelling
is proposed. Previous developments provide solutions to the hierarchical
forecasting problem by algebra manipulations based on forecasts produced
by independent models for each time series involved in the hierarchy.
The solutions produce optimal reconciled forecasts for each individual
forecast horizon, but the link along time that is implied by the
dynamics of the models is completely ignored. Therefore, the novel
approach in this paper improves upon past research at least in two key
points. Firstly, the algebra is already encoded in the State Space
system and the Kalman Filter algorithm, giving an elegant and clean
solution to the problem. Secondly, the State Space approach is optimal
both across the hierarchy, as expected, but also along time, something
missing in past developments. The approach is assessed by comparing its
forecasting performance to the existing methods, through simulations and
using real data of a Spanish grocery retailer.}},

second half of the 20th century. Mortality modeling and forecasting have
therefore attracted increasing attention from various areas, such as the
public pension systems, commercial insurance sectors, as well as
actuarial, demographic and epidemiological research. Compared to the
aggregate mortality experience, cause-specific mortality rates contain
more detailed information, and can help us better understand the ongoing
mortality improvements. However, when conducting cause-of-death
mortality modeling, it is important to ensure coherence in the
forecasts. That is, the forecasts of cause-specific mortality rates
should add up to the forecasts of the aggregate mortality rates. In this
paper, we propose a novel forecast reconciliation approach to achieve
this goal. We use the age-specific mortality experience in the U.S.
during 1970-2015 as a case study. Seven major causes of death are
considered in this paper. By incorporating both the disaggregate
cause-specific data and the aggregate total-level data, we achieve
better forecasting results at both levels and coherence across
forecasts. Moreover, we perform a cluster analysis on the cause-specific
mortality data. It is shown that combining mortality experience from
causes with similar mortality patterns can provide additional useful
information, and thus further improve forecast accuracy. Finally, based
on the proposed reconciliation approach, we conduct a scenario-based
analysis to project future mortality rates under the assumption of
certain causes being eliminated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

 abstract = {{Large collections of time series often have aggregation constraints due
to product or geographical groupings. The forecasts for the most
disaggregated series are usually required to add-up exactly to the
forecasts of the aggregated series, a constraint we refer to as
``coherence.{''} Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting
forecasts to make them coherent. The reconciliation algorithm proposed
by Hyndman et al. (2011) is based on a generalized least squares
estimator that requires an estimate of the covariance matrix of the
coherency errors (i.e., the errors that arise due to incoherence). We
show that this matrix is impossible to estimate in practice due to
identifiability conditions. We propose a new forecast reconciliation
approach that incorporates the information from a full covariance matrix
of forecast errors in obtaining a set of coherent forecasts. Our
approach minimizes the mean squared error of the coherent forecasts
across the entire collection of time series under the assumption of
unbiasedness. The minimization problem has a closed-form solution. We
make this solution scalable by providing a computationally efficient
representation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method
compared to alternative methods using a series of simulation designs
which take into account various features of the collected time series.

obesity grew by 5\%.
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the demand and associated costs
for hospital-based back surgery by geolocation over time to evaluate
provider practice variation. The study then leveraged hierarchical time
series to generate tight demand forecasts on an unobserved test set.
Finally, explanatory financial, technical, workload, geographical, and
temporal factors as well as state-level obesity rates were investigated
as predictors for the demand for hospital-based back surgery.
Methods: Hospital data from January 2012 to December 2017 were used to
generate geospatial-temporal maps and a video of the Current Procedural
Terminology codes beginning with the digit 63 claims. Hierarchical time
series modeling provided forecasts for each state, the census regions,
and the nation for an unobserved test set and then again for the
out-years of 2018 and 2019. Stepwise regression, lasso regression, ridge
regression, elastic net, and gradient-boosted random forests were built
on a training set and evaluated on a test set to evaluate variables
important to explaining the demand for hospital-based back surgery.
Results: Widespread, unexplained practice variation over time was seen
using geographical information systems (GIS) multimedia mapping.
Hierarchical time series provided accurate forecasts on a blind dataset
and suggested a 6.52\% (from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 529,777 in
2018) growth of hospital-based back surgery in 2018 (529,777 and up to
13.00\% by 2019 {[}from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 563,023 procedures

\$323.9 million. Extreme gradient-boosted random forests beat
constrained and unconstrained regression models on a 20\% unobserved
test set and suggested that obesity is one of the most important factors
in explaining the increase in demand for hospital-based back surgery.
Conclusions: Practice variation and obesity are factors to consider when
estimating demand for hospital-based back surgery. Federal, state, and
local planners should evaluate demand-side and supply-side interventions

 abstract = {{The sum of forecasts of disaggregated time series is often required to
equal the forecast of the aggregate, giving a set of coherent forecasts.
The least squares solution for finding coherent forecasts uses a
reconciliation approach known as MinT, proposed by Wickramasuriya,
Athanasopoulos, and Hyndman (2019). The MinT approach and its variants
do not guarantee that the coherent forecasts are non-negative, even when
all of the original forecasts are non-negative in nature. This has
become a serious issue in applications that are inherently non-negative
such as with sales data or tourism numbers. While overcoming this
difficulty, we reconsider the least squares minimization problem with
non-negativity constraints to ensure that the coherent forecasts are
strictly non-negative. The constrained quadratic programming problem is
solved using three algorithms. They are the block principal pivoting
(BPV) algorithm, projected conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm, and
scaled gradient projection algorithm. A Monte Carlo simulation is
performed to evaluate the computational performances of these algorithms
as the number of time series increases. The results demonstrate that the
BPV algorithm clearly outperforms the rest, and PCG is the second best.
The superior performance of the BPV algorithm can be partially
attributed to the alternative representation of the weight matrix in the
MinT approach. An empirical investigation is carried out to assess the
impact of imposing non-negativity constraints on forecast reconciliation
over the unconstrained method. It is observed that slight gains in
forecast accuracy have occurred at the most disaggregated level. At the
aggregated level, slight losses are also observed. Although the gains or
losses are negligible, the procedure plays an important role in decision
and policy implementation processes.}},
