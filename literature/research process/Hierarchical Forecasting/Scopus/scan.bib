 abstract = {We propose the use of hierarchical structures for forecasting freight earnings. Hierarchical time series approaches are applied in the dry-bulk and tanker markets to identify the most suitable strategy for forecasting freight rates. We argue that decision making for shipping practitioners should be based on forecasts of freight earnings at different hierarchical levels. In other words, different strategic shipping decisions such as operations management, choice of freight charter contract and type of investment should be matched with the appropriate level of forecasts of freight earnings that are aggregated at different macro-levels: operating route, vessel size and type of trade. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Hierarchical time series is a first order of importance topic. Effectively, there are several applications where time series can be naturally disaggregated in a hierarchical structure using attributes such as geographical location, product type, etc. Power networks face interesting problems related to its transition to computer-aided grids. Data can be naturally disaggregated in a hierarchical structure, and there is the possibility to look for both single and aggregated points along the grid. Along this work, we applied different hierarchical forecasting methods to them. Three different approaches are compared, two common approaches, bottom-up approach, top-down approach and another one based on the hierarchical structure of data, the optimal regression combination. The evaluation considers short-term forecasting (24-h ahead). Additionally,we discussed the importance associated to the correlation degree among series to improve forecasting accuracy. Our results demonstrated that the hierarchical approach outperforms bottom-up approach at intermediate/high levels. At lower levels, it presents a superior performance in less homogeneous substations, i. e. for the substations linked to different type of customers. Additionally, its performance is comparable to the top-down approach at top levels. This approach revealed to be an interesting tool for hierarchical data analysis. It allows to achieve a good performance at top levels as the top-down approach and at same time it allows to capture series dynamics at bottom levels as the bottom-up. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

@article{Auder2018,
 abstract = {Smart grids require flexible data driven forecasting methods. We propose clustering tools for bottom-up short-term load forecasting. We focus on individual consumption data analysis which plays a major role for energy management and electricity load forecasting. The first section is dedicated to the industrial context and a review of individual electrical data analysis. Then, we focus on hierarchical time-series for bottom-up forecasting. The idea is to decompose the global signal and obtain disaggregated forecasts in such a way that their sum enhances the prediction. This is done in three steps: identify a rather large number of super-consumers by clustering their energy profiles, generate a hierarchy of nested partitions and choose the one that minimize a prediction criterion. Using a nonparametric model to handle forecasting, and wavelets to define various notions of similarity between load curves, this disaggregation strategy gives a 16% improvement in forecasting accuracy when applied to French individual consumers. Then, this strategy is implemented using R-the free software environment for statistical computing-so that it can scale when dealing with massive datasets. The proposed solution is to make the algorithm scalable combine data storage, parallel computing and double clustering step to define the super-consumers. The resulting software is openly available. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

 abstract = {With increasing renewable energy generation capacities connected to the power grid, a number of decision-making problems require some form of consistency in the forecasts that are being used as input. In everyday words, one expects that the sum of the power generation forecasts for a set of wind farms is equal to the forecast made directly for the power generation of that portfolio. This forecast reconciliation problem has attracted increased attention in the energy forecasting literature over the last few years. Here, we review the state of the art and its applicability to day-ahead forecasting of wind power generation, in the context of spatial reconciliation. After gathering some observations on the properties of the game-theoretical optimal projection reconciliation approach, we propose to readily rethink it in a distributed setup by using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Three case studies are considered for illustrating the interest and performance of the approach, based on simulated data, the National Renewable Energy Labaratory (NREL) Wind Toolkit dataset, and a dataset for a number of geographically distributed wind farms in Sardinia, Italy. © 2019 by the authors.},

Time series data used in these areas is often hierarchically organized and thus, aggregated along the hierarchy levels based on their dimensional features. Calculating forecasts in these environments is very time consuming, due to ensuring forecasting consistency between hierarchy levels. To increase the forecasting efficiency for hierarchically organized time series, we introduce a novel forecasting approach that takes advantage of the hierarchical organization. There, we reuse the forecast models maintained on the lowest level of the hierarchy to almost instantly create already estimated forecast models on higher hierarchical levels. In addition, we define a hierarchical communication framework, increasing the communication flexibility and efficiency. Our experiments show significant runtime improvements for creating a forecast model at higher hierarchical levels, while still providing a very high accuracy.

@conference{Fischer2012120,
 abstract = {Time series forecasting is challenging as sophisticated forecast models are computationally expensive to build. Recent research has addressed the integration of forecasting inside a DBMS. One main benefit is that models can be created once and then repeatedly used to answer forecast queries. Often forecast queries are submitted on higher aggregation levels, e.g., forecasts of sales over all locations. To answer such a forecast query, we have two possibilities. First, we can aggregate all base time series (sales in Austria, sales in Belgium ...) and create only one model for the aggregate time series. Second, we can create models for all base time series and aggregate the base forecast values. The second possibility might lead to a higher accuracy but it is usually too expensive due to a high number of base time series. However, we actually do not need all base models to achieve a high accuracy, a sample of base models is enough. With this approach, we still achieve a better accuracy than an aggregate model, very similar to using all models, but we need less models to create and maintain in the database. We further improve this approach if new actual values of the base time series arrive at different points in time. With each new actual value we can refine the aggregate forecast and eventually converge towards the real actual value. Our experimental evaluation using several real-world data sets, shows a high accuracy of our approaches and a fast convergence towards the optimal value with increasing sample sizes and increasing number of actual values respectively.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hospital-based back surgery in the United States increased by 60% from January 2012 to December 2017, yet the supply of neurosurgeons remained relatively constant. During this time, adult obesity grew by 5%. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the demand and associated costs for hospital-based back surgery by geolocation over time to evaluate provider practice variation. The study then leveraged hierarchical time series to generate tight demand forecasts on an unobserved test set. Finally, explanatory financial, technical, workload, geographical, and temporal factors as well as state-level obesity rates were investigated as predictors for the demand for hospital-based back surgery. METHODS: Hospital data from January 2012 to December 2017 were used to generate geospatial-temporal maps and a video of the Current Procedural Terminology codes beginning with the digit 63 claims. Hierarchical time series modeling provided forecasts for each state, the census regions, and the nation for an unobserved test set and then again for the out-years of 2018 and 2019. Stepwise regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, elastic net, and gradient-boosted random forests were built on a training set and evaluated on a test set to evaluate variables important to explaining the demand for hospital-based back surgery. RESULTS: Widespread, unexplained practice variation over time was seen using geographical information systems (GIS) multimedia mapping. Hierarchical time series provided accurate forecasts on a blind dataset and suggested a 6.52% (from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 529,777 in 2018) growth of hospital-based back surgery in 2018 (529,777 and up to 13.00% by 2019 [from 497,325 procedures in 2017 to 563,023 procedures in 2019]). The increase in payments by 2019 are estimated to be US $323.9 million. Extreme gradient-boosted random forests beat constrained and unconstrained regression models on a 20% unobserved test set and suggested that obesity is one of the most important factors in explaining the increase in demand for hospital-based back surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Practice variation and obesity are factors to consider when estimating demand for hospital-based back surgery. Federal, state, and local planners should evaluate demand-side and supply-side interventions for this emerging problem. ©Lawrence Fulton, Clemens Scott Kruse.

 abstract = {In many applications, there are multiple time series that are hierarchically organized and can be aggregated at several different levels in groups based on products, geography or some other features. We call these "hierarchical time series". They are commonly forecast using either a "bottom-up" or a "top-down" method. In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Our method is based on independently forecasting all series at all levels of the hierarchy and then using a regression model to optimally combine and reconcile these forecasts. The resulting revised forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy, are unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all combination forecasts under some simple assumptions. We show in a simulation study that our method performs well compared to the top-down approach and the bottom-up method. We demonstrate our proposed method by forecasting Australian tourism demand where the data are disaggregated by purpose of travel and geographical region. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This hierarchical structure can be useful for improving the forecast, and this strategy is known as hierarchical time series (HTS) analysis. In this work, a novel strategy for sales forecasting is proposed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and hierarchical time series. We formalize three different hierarchical time series approaches: bottom-up SVR, top-down SVR, and middle-out SVR, and use them in a sales forecasting project for the Travel Retail Industry. Various hierarchical structures are proposed for the retail industry in order to achieve accurate product-level predictions.

 abstract = {In economics we often face a system which intrinsically imposes a structure of hierarchy of its components, i.e., in modeling trade accounts related to foreign exchange or in optimization of regional air protection policy. A problem of reconciliation of forecasts obtained on different levels of hierarchy has been addressed in the statistical and econometric literature many times and concerns bringing together forecasts obtained independently at different levels of hierarchy. This paper deals with this issue with regard to a hierarchical functional time series. We present and critically discuss a state of art and indicate opportunities of an application of these methods to a certain environment protection problem. We critically compare the best predictor known from the literature with our own original proposal.

@article{Li2019122,
 abstract = {Life expectancy has been increasing sharply around the globe since the second half of the 20th century. Mortality modeling and forecasting have therefore attracted increasing attention from various areas, such as the public pension systems, commercial insurance sectors, as well as actuarial, demographic and epidemiological research. Compared to the aggregate mortality experience, cause-specific mortality rates contain more detailed information, and can help us better understand the ongoing mortality improvements. However, when conducting cause-of-death mortality modeling, it is important to ensure coherence in the forecasts. That is, the forecasts of cause-specific mortality rates should add up to the forecasts of the aggregate mortality rates. In this paper, we propose a novel forecast reconciliation approach to achieve this goal. We use the age-specific mortality experience in the U.S. during 1970–2015 as a case study. Seven major causes of death are considered in this paper. By incorporating both the disaggregate cause-specific data and the aggregate total-level data, we achieve better forecasting results at both levels and coherence across forecasts. Moreover, we perform a cluster analysis on the cause-specific mortality data. It is shown that combining mortality experience from causes with similar mortality patterns can provide additional useful information, and thus further improve forecast accuracy. Finally, based on the proposed reconciliation approach, we conduct a scenario-based analysis to project future mortality rates under the assumption of certain causes being eliminated. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {In recent decades, there has been significant growth in the capital market for mortality- and longevity-linked bonds. Therefore, modeling and forecasting the mortality indexes underlying these bonds have crucial implications for risk management in life insurance companies. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical reconciliation approach to constructing probabilistic forecasts for mortality bond indexes. We apply this approach to analyzing the Swiss Re Kortis bond, which is the first longevity trend bond introduced in the market. We express the longevity divergence index associated with the bond's principal reduction factor (PRF) in a hierarchical setting. We first adopt time-series models to obtain forecasts on each hierarchical level, and then apply a minimum trace reconciliation approach to ensure coherence of forecasts across all levels. Based on the reconciled probabilistic forecasts of the longevity divergence index, we estimate the probability distribution of the PRF of the Kortis bond, and compare our results with those stated in Standard and Poor's report on pre-sale information. We also illustrate the strong performance of the approach by comparing the reconciled forecasts with unreconciled forecasts as well as those from the bottom-up approach and the optimal combination approach. Finally, we provide first insights on the interest spread of the Kortis bond throughout its risk period 2010-2016. © Astin Bulletin 2019.},

 abstract = {Hierarchical time-series comprises of several dataset maintaining certain hierarchical relationship among them. There are certain specialized strategies, viz. top-down, bottom-up, middle-out and optimal approaches which take care of predicting future values for such multi-level data. For forecasting of individual series at different levels of hierarchy, a method of aggregation or disaggregation is followed. In the present study, these methodologies are investigated thoroughly. Further, state-wise seasonal sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) moench] production data of India is analyzed by employing the hierarchical forecasting approaches. A comparative study on performance of different methods is carried out from the viewpoint of multi-step-ahead forecasts on the basis of Mean absolute error (MAE) and Root mean square error (RMSE). The findings show that the middle-out technique outperforms other approaches and traditional method of forecasting as well. This fact has been confirmed statistically by using pair-wise t-test. Finally, using the middle-out approach, forecasts of sorghum production for 2015 till 2017 have been carried out at all hierarchical levels.

@conference{Pang20183506,
 abstract = {Electricity demand forecasting is a very important problem for energy supply and environmental protection. It can be formalized as a hierarchical time series forecasting problem with the aggregation constraints according to the geographical hierarchy, since the sum of the prediction results of the disaggregated time series should be equal to the prediction results of the aggregated ones. However in most previous work, the aggregation consistency is ensured at the loss of forecast accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering-based hierarchical electricity time series forecasting approach. Instead of dealing with the geographical hierarchy directly, we explore electricity consumption patterns by clustering analysis and build a new consumption pattern based time series hierarchy. We then present a novel hierarchical forecasting method with consumption hierarchical aggregation constraints to improve the electricity demand predictions of the bottom level, followed by a “bottom-up” method to obtain forecasts of the geographical higher levels. Especially, we observe that in our consumption pattern based hierarchy the reconciliation error of the bottom level time series is “correlated” to its membership degree of the corresponding cluster (consumption pattern), and hence apply this correlations as the regularization term in our forecasting objective function. Extensive experiments on real-life datasets verify that our approach achieves the best prediction accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2018 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

The 2017 Global Energy Forecasting Competition (GEFCom2017) focused on addressing this topic. Quantile forecasts for eight zones and two aggregated zones in New England were required for every hour of a future month. This paper presents a new methodology for forecasting quantiles in a hierarchy which outperforms a commonly-used benchmark model. A simulation-based approach was used to generate demand forecasts. Adjustments were made to each of the demand simulations to ensure that all zonal forecasts reconciled appropriately, and a weighted reconciliation approach was implemented to ensure that the bottom-level zonal forecasts summed correctly to the aggregated zonal forecasts. We show that reconciling in this manner improves the forecast accuracy.

 abstract = {Age-specific mortality rates are often disaggregated by different attributes, such as sex, state, ethnic group and socioeconomic status. In making social policies and pricing annuity at national and subnational levels, it is important not only to forecast mortality accurately, but also to ensure that forecasts at the subnational level add up to the forecasts at the national level. This motivates recent developments in grouped functional time series methods (Shang and Hyndman, in press) to reconcile age-specific mortality forecasts. We extend these grouped functional time series forecasting methods to multivariate time series, and apply them to produce point forecasts of mortality rates at older ages, from which fixed-term annuities for different ages and maturities can be priced. Using the regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one-step-ahead to 15-step-ahead point-forecast accuracy between the independent and grouped forecasting methods. The grouped forecasting methods are shown not only to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at national and subnational levels, but they are also shown to allow improved forecast accuracy. The improved forecast accuracy of mortality rates is of great interest to the insurance and pension industries for estimating annuity prices, in particular at the level of population subgroups, defined by key factors such as sex, region, and socioeconomic grouping. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Age-specific mortality rates are often disaggregated by different attributes, such as sex, state, and ethnicity. Forecasting age-specific mortality rates at the national and sub-national levels plays an important role in developing social policy. However, independent forecasts at the sub-national levels may not add up to the forecasts at the national level. To address this issue, we consider reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates, extending the methods of Hyndman et al. in 2011 to functional time series, where age is considered as a continuum. The grouped functional time series methods are used to produce point forecasts of mortality rates that are aggregated appropriately across different disaggregation factors. For evaluating forecast uncertainty, we propose a bootstrap method for reconciling interval forecasts. Using the regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan, obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one- to ten-step-ahead point and interval forecast accuracies between the independent and grouped functional time series forecasting methods. The proposed methods are shown to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at the national and sub-national levels. They also enjoy improved forecast accuracy averaged over different disaggregation factors.

 abstract = {Accurate electricity demand forecast plays a key role in sustainable power systems. It enables better decision making in the planning of electricity generation and distribution for many use cases. The electricity demand data can often be represented in a hierarchical structure. For example, the electricity consumption of a whole country could be disaggregated by states, cities, and households. Hierarchical forecasts require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the consistency between different levels. State-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods usually apply adjustments on the individual level forecasts to satisfy the aggregation constraints. However, the high-dimensionality of the unpenalized regression problem and the estimation errors in the high-dimensional error covariance matrix can lead to increased variability in the revised forecasts with poor prediction performance. In order to provide more robustness to estimation errors in the adjustments, we present a new hierarchical forecasting algorithm that computes sparse adjustments while still preserving the aggregation constraints. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional penalized regression, which can be efficiently solved using cyclical coordinate descent methods. We also conduct experiments using a large-scale hierarchical electricity demand data. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods, in both the sparsity of the adjustments and the prediction accuracy. The proposed approach to hierarchical forecasting could be useful for energy generation including solar and wind energy, as well as numerous other applications.

Hierarchical forecasting require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the coherency between different levels-the property that forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy. A fundamental limitation of prior research is the focus on forecasting the mean of each time series. We consider the situation where probabilistic forecasts are needed for each series in the hierarchy, and propose an algorithm to compute predictive distributions rather than mean forecasts only. Our algorithm has the advantage of synthesizing information from different levels in the hierarchy through a sparse forecast combination and a probabilistic hierarchical aggregation. We evaluate the accuracy of our forecasting algorithm on both simulated data and large-scale electricity smart meter data.

 abstract = {In hierarchical time series (HTS) forecasting, the hierarchical relation between multiple time series is exploited to make better forecasts. This hierarchical relation implies one or more aggregate consistency constraints that the series are known to satisfy. Many existing approaches, like for example bottom-up or topdown forecasting, therefore attempt to achieve this goal in a way that guarantees that the forecasts will also be aggregate consistent. We propose to split the problem of HTS into two independent steps: first one comes up with the best possible forecasts for the time series without worrying about aggregate consistency; and then a reconciliation procedure is used to make the forecasts aggregate consistent. We introduce a Game-Theoretically OPtimal (GTOP) reconciliation method, which is guaranteed to only improve any given set of forecasts. This opens up new possibilities for constructing the forecasts. For example, it is not necessary to assume that bottom-level forecasts are unbiased, and aggregate forecasts may be constructed by regressing both on bottom-level forecasts and on other covariates that may only be available at the aggregate level. We illustrate the benefits of our approach both on simulated data and on real electricity consumption data. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

 abstract = {Time series forecasting plays an important role in many decision support systems, also in those related to the management of supply chains. Forecast accuracy is, therefore, essential to optimise the efficiency of any supply chain. One aspect that is often overlooked is the fact that sales of many products within an organization are assembled as complex hierarchies with different levels of aggregation. Very often forecasts are produced regardless of such structure, though forecasting accuracy may be improved by taking it into account. In this paper, an approach for hierarchical time series forecasting based on State Space modelling is proposed. Previous developments provide solutions to the hierarchical forecasting problem by algebra manipulations based on forecasts produced by independent models for each time series involved in the hierarchy. The solutions produce optimal reconciled forecasts for each individual forecast horizon, but the link along time that is implied by the dynamics of the models is completely ignored. Therefore, the novel approach in this paper improves upon past research at least in two key points. Firstly, the algebra is already encoded in the State Space system and the Kalman Filter algorithm, giving an elegant and clean solution to the problem. Secondly, the State Space approach is optimal both across the hierarchy, as expected, but also along time, something missing in past developments. The approach is assessed by comparing its forecasting performance to the existing methods, through simulations and using real data of a Spanish grocery retailer. © 2018},

 abstract = {Large collections of time series often have aggregation constraints due to product or geographical groupings. The forecasts for the most disaggregated series are usually required to add-up exactly to the forecasts of the aggregated series, a constraint we refer to as “coherence.” Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent. The reconciliation algorithm proposed by Hyndman et al. (2011) is based on a generalized least squares estimator that requires an estimate of the covariance matrix of the coherency errors (i.e., the errors that arise due to incoherence). We show that this matrix is impossible to estimate in practice due to identifiability conditions. We propose a new forecast reconciliation approach that incorporates the information from a full covariance matrix of forecast errors in obtaining a set of coherent forecasts. Our approach minimizes the mean squared error of the coherent forecasts across the entire collection of time series under the assumption of unbiasedness. The minimization problem has a closed-form solution. We make this solution scalable by providing a computationally efficient representation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method compared to alternative methods using a series of simulation designs which take into account various features of the collected time series. This is followed by an empirical application using Australian domestic tourism data. The results indicate that the proposed method works well with artificial and real data.

@article{Wickramasuriya2020,
 abstract = {The sum of forecasts of disaggregated time series is often required to equal the forecast of the aggregate, giving a set of coherent forecasts. The least squares solution for finding coherent forecasts uses a reconciliation approach known as MinT, proposed by Wickramasuriya, Athanasopoulos, and Hyndman (2019). The MinT approach and its variants do not guarantee that the coherent forecasts are non-negative, even when all of the original forecasts are non-negative in nature. This has become a serious issue in applications that are inherently non-negative such as with sales data or tourism numbers. While overcoming this difficulty, we reconsider the least squares minimization problem with non-negativity constraints to ensure that the coherent forecasts are strictly non-negative. The constrained quadratic programming problem is solved using three algorithms. They are the block principal pivoting (BPV) algorithm, projected conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm, and scaled gradient projection algorithm. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the computational performances of these algorithms as the number of time series increases. The results demonstrate that the BPV algorithm clearly outperforms the rest, and PCG is the second best. The superior performance of the BPV algorithm can be partially attributed to the alternative representation of the weight matrix in the MinT approach. An empirical investigation is carried out to assess the impact of imposing non-negativity constraints on forecast reconciliation over the unconstrained method. It is observed that slight gains in forecast accuracy have occurred at the most disaggregated level. At the aggregated level, slight losses are also observed. Although the gains or losses are negligible, the procedure plays an important role in decision and policy implementation processes. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {Forecasting of solar PV generation plays an important role in power system operations. Forecasts are required on various geographical and temporal scales, which can be modeled as hierarchies. In a geographical hierarchy, the overall forecast for the region can either be obtained by directly forecasting the regional time series or by aggregating the individual forecasts generated for the sub-regions. This leads to a problem known as aggregate inconsistency as the two sets of forecasts are most likely different due to modeling uncertainties. Hence, practice is not optimal. Statistically optimal aggregation known as reconciliation, has been proven to provide aggregate consistent forecasts. Reconciliation helps system operators to have a superior foresight in a region-wise level, which eventually results in efficient system planning. The focus of this paper is on improving reconciliation accuracy. In addition, the effects of more accurate disaggregated and aggregated forecasts on the final reconciled predictions have been analyzed. A total of 318 simulated PV plants in California have been used to build a geographical hierarchy. More accurate NWP based and aggregated level forecasts are obtained with model output statistics and artificial neural network models. Significant improvements are observed in reconciled forecasts without using any exogenous information. © 2018 IEEE.},

 abstract = {To integrate solar energy into the electricity grid reliably and efficiently, different forecasting techniques are used to produce forecasts at various forecast horizons using data of different levels of aggregation. For example, power generated by distributed photovoltaics (PV) can be disaggregated in a geographical hierarchy into transmission zones, distribution nodes, PV plants, subsystems and inverters; forecasts are required at all of these levels to facilitate different power system operations and power plant management. Due to the different information sets visible to different players in the hierarchy, such as PV plant owners and independent system operators, the forecasts produced at different aggregation levels are often not optimal. Furthermore, these forecasts are aggregate inconsistent, i.e., forecasts made using data collected at lower levels do not add up exactly to the forecasts made using higher level data. In this paper, the state-of-the-art forecast reconciliation techniques are explored. By minimizing the trace of forecast error covariance matrix, the base forecasts obtained across the hierarchy can be optimally reconciled. The reconciled forecasts not only aggregate consistently, and thus lead to collaborative decision making, but also improve the base forecasts at each level significantly. The merit of the reconciliation framework goes to the fact that it does not require any additional information other than those base forecasts. Furthermore, forecast improvements are independent of the base forecasting methods. In other words, once the base forecasts are generated with our favorite methods, the reconciliation will most likely improve those forecasts further. The reconciliation techniques can be applied to a variety of hierarchies with different forecast horizons. The empirical part of this work considers two examples, namely, an NWP-based day-ahead forecast reconciliation over 318 simulated PV plants in the state of California, and a spatio-temporal statistical 1-min-ahead forecast reconciliation over 17 irradiance sensors on the Oahu Island, Hawaii. It is shown that reconciliation benefits both the gird operators and PV system owners by bringing more accurate forecasts, and thus motivates information sharing in an electricity grid. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Previously in “Reconciling solar forecasts: Geographical hierarchy” [Solar Energy 146 (2017) 276–286], we have demonstrated that by reconciling the forecasts obtained from a geographical hierarchy (formed by levels such as transmission zones, distribution nodes, PV plants, subsystems and inverters), more accurate forecasts can be obtained as compared to forecasts produced using only the information from a single level. Furthermore, these reconciled forecasts are aggregate consistent, facilitating different power system operations and power plant management. In this paper, we continue our discussion on hierarchical reconciliation and consider another type of hierarchy, namely, temporal hierarchy. A temporal hierarchy can be constructed by aggregating a high-frequency time series (e.g., hourly) into different low-frequency time series (e.g., 6-hourly and daily). While the measurements in a temporal hierarchy sum up consistently (e.g., the first two points in an hourly time series sum up to be the first point in the 2-hourly time series), the forecasts in general do not sum up, due to the different models used to generate forecasts. This inconsistency poses an apparent problem when selecting forecasts. Using reconciliation could mitigate the problem by reconciling different forecasts obtained at different timescales, and thus generating aggregate consistent forecasts. In addition, the reconciled forecasts reduce modeling uncertainties using combinations – similar to the ensemble forecasting used in numerical weather prediction (NWP) – and thus improve forecast accuracy. The empirical part of the paper consists an NWP-based day-ahead forecast reconciliation example. Hourly data from 318 sites in California, over a period of 1 year, is used. Over 50 million forecasts are produced in this paper, in an operational forecasting context. Temporal reconciliation is shown to significantly outperform NWP forecasts produced by 3TIER, with a forecast skill (computed based on 3TIER forecasts) up to 0.3. Since reconciliation does not require any additional information, such improvement is thus encouraging. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Text mining is an emerging topic that advances the review of academic literature. This paper presents a preliminary study on how to review solar irradiance and photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting (both topics combined as “solar forecasting” for short) using text mining, which serves as the first part of a forthcoming series of text mining applications in solar forecasting. This study contains three main contributions: (1) establishing the technological infrastructure (authors, journals & conferences, publications, and organizations) of solar forecasting via the top 1000 papers returned by a Google Scholar search; (2) consolidating the frequently-used abbreviations in solar forecasting by mining the full texts of 249 ScienceDirect publications; and (3) identifying key innovations in recent advances in solar forecasting (e.g., shadow camera, forecast reconciliation). As most of the steps involved in the above analysis are automated via an application programming interface, the presented method can be transferred to other solar engineering topics, or any other scientific domain, by means of changing the search word. The authors acknowledge that text mining, at its present stage, serves as a complement to, but not a replacement of, conventional review papers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

@article{Yang2019474,
 abstract = {Hierarchical time series is a set of time series organized by aggregation constraints and it is widely used in many real-world applications. Usually, hierarchical time series forecasting can be realized with a two-step method, in which all time series are forecasted independently and then the forecasting results are reconciled to satisfy aggregation consistency. However, these two-step methods have a high computational complexity and are unable to ensure optimal forecasts for all time series. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical forecasting approach to solve the above problems. Based on multi-task learning, we construct an integrated model that combines features of the bottom level series and the hierarchical structure. Then forecasts of all time series are output simultaneously and they are aggregated consistently. The model has the advantage of utilizing the correlation between time series. And the forecasting results are overall optimal by optimizing a global loss function. In order to avoid the curse of dimensionality as the number of time series grows larger, we further learn a sparse model with group sparsity and element-wise sparsity constraints according to data characteristics. The experimental results on simulation data and tourism data demonstrate that our method has a better overall performance while simplifying forecasting process. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

 abstract = {European Monetary Union member countries’ forecasts are often combined to obtain the forecasts of the Euro area macroeconomic aggregate variables. The aggregation weights which are used to produce the aggregates are often considered as combination weights. This paper investigates whether using different combination weights instead of the usual aggregation weights can help to provide more accurate forecasts. In this context, we examine the performance of equal weights, the least squares estimators of the weights, the combination method recently proposed by Hyndman et al. (Comput Stat Data Anal 55(9):2579–2589, 2011) and the weights suggested by shrinkage methods. We find that some variables like real GDP and the GDP deflator can be forecasted more precisely by using flexible combination weights. Furthermore, combining only forecasts of the three largest European countries helps to improve the forecasting performance. The persistence of the individual series seems to play an important role for the relative performance of the combination. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Therefore, fitting a given time series model to aggregated data can be time consuming and may lead to a loss of forecasting accuracy.

 abstract = {Crowdfunding is an emerging Internet fundraising mechanism by raising monetary contributions from the crowd for projects or ventures. In these platforms, the dynamics, i.e., daily funding amount on campaigns and perks (backing options with rewards), are the most concerned issue for creators, backers and platforms. However, tracking the dynamics in crowdfunding is very challenging and still under-explored. To that end, in this paper, we present a focused study on this important problem. A special goal is to forecast the funding amount for a given campaign and its perks in the future days. Specifically, we formalize the dynamics in crowdfunding as a hierarchical time series, i.e., campaign level and perk level. Specific to each level, we develop a special regression by modeling the decision making process of the crowd (visitors and backing probability) and exploring various factors that impact the decision; on this basis, an enhanced switching regression is proposed at each level to address the heterogeneity of funding sequences. Further, we employ a revision matrix to combine the two-level base forecasts for the final forecasting. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world crowdfunding data collected from Indiegogo.com. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on tracking the dynamics in crowdfunding. © 2017 ACM.},
