We created nowcast models for 10 California beaches using weather, oceanographic, and other environmental variables as input to tuned regression models to predict if FIB concentrations were above single sample water quality standards. Rainfall was used as a variable in nearly every model. The models were calibrated and validated using historical data. Subsequently, models were implemented during the 2017 swim season in collaboration with local beach managers.

Anti-HCV prevalence in the GP varied widely in the MENA region from 0.1% (study dates not reported) in the United Arab Emirates to 2.1%-13.5% (2003-2006) in Pakistan and 14.7% (2008) in Egypt. Data were not identified for Bahrain, Jordan, or Palestine. Good quality estimates of anti-HCV prevalence in the GP were reported for Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Pakistan, Syria, Sudan, Tunisia, and Yemen. Anti-HCV incidence estimates in the GP were reported only for Egypt (0.8-6.8 per 1000 person-year, 1997-2003). In Egypt, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates, viremic rates in anti-HCV-positive individuals from the GP were approximately 70%. In the GP, the viremic prevalence varied from 0.7% (2011) in Saudi Arabia to 5.8% (2007-2008) in Pakistan and 10.0% (2008) in Egypt. Anti-HCV prevalence was lower in blood donors than in the GP, ranging from 0.2% (1992-1993) in Algeria to 1.7% (2005) in Yemen. The reporting quality of the outcomes in blood donors was good in the MENA countries, except in Qatar where no time framework was reported for the outcome. Some countries had anti-HCV prevalence estimates for children, transfused patients, contacts of HCV-infected patients, prisoners, sex workers, and men who have sex with men.; Conclusion: A substantial proportion of the reported outcomes may not help policymakers to develop micro-elimination strategies with precise HCV infection prevention and treatment programs in the region, as nowcasting HCV epidemiology using these data is potentially difficult. In addition to providing accurate information on HCV epidemiology, outcomes should also demonstrate practical and clinical significance and relevance. Based on the available data, most countries in the region have low to moderate anti-HCV prevalence. To achieve HCV elimination by 2030, up-to-date, good quality data on HCV epidemiology are required for the GP and key populations such as people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men.",article,3003847120180721,Other topic.

Supplementing surveillance data with proxy estimates generally improves the quality of forecasts and transient reporting errors degrade the performance of all three approaches considerably. The improvement in quality from ad hoc and post-forecast changes suggests that domain experts continue to possess information that is not being sufficiently captured by current forecasting approaches.

The purpose of this study was to make use of the daily number of visiting patients to forecast the daily true number of patients. Our main contribution is that we take the reporting delays into consideration and propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for this forecast problem. The data shows that there were 21,226 confirmed cases reported among 21,866 visiting patients, a proportion as high as 97%. Given this observation, the Bayesian hierarchical model was established to predict the daily true number of patients using the number of visiting patients. We propose several scoring rules to assess the performance of different nowcasting procedures. We conclude that Bayesian nowcasting with consideration of right truncation of the reporting delays has a good performance for short-term forecasting, and could effectively predict the epidemic trends of foodborne diseases.

To reduce the risk of exposure to fecal contamination, informing beachgoers in advance about the microbial water quality is important. Currently, determining the level of fecal contamination takes 24 h. The objective of this study is to predict the current level of fecal contamination (enterococcus [ENT] and ) using readily available environmental variables. Artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) models were constructed using data from the Haeundae and Gwangalli Beaches in Busan City. The input variables included the tidal level, air and water temperature, solar radiation, wind direction and velocity, precipitation, discharge from the wastewater treatment plant, and suspended solid concentration in beach water. The dependence of fecal contamination on the input variables was statistically evaluated; precipitation, discharge from the wastewater treatment plant, and wind direction at the two beaches were positively correlated to the changes in the two bacterial concentrations ( < 0.01), whereas solar radiation was negatively correlated ( < 0.01). The performance of the ANN model for predicting ENT and at Gwangalli Beach was significantly higher than that of the SVR model with the training dataset ( < 0.05). Based on the comparison of residual values between the predicted and observed fecal indicator bacteria concentrations in two models, the ANN demonstrated better performance than SVR.

The concept of pre-emptive medicine considers the time-course of a disease in each individual and seeks medical interventions to prevent disease progression. Suitable and promising targets for pre-emptive medicine are non-communicable diseases, including hypertension. Recent advances in genomic analysis, information technology, and artificial intelligence should make this medical concept feasible in the near future. In this review, we focused on pre-emptive medicine for hypertension, referring to concrete plans for the future direction of this research. The ultimate goal of pre-emptive medicine is to completely prevent the onset and progression of hypertension by precisely predicting the elevation of blood pressure and performing interventions to avoid it. The diagnostic processes of hypertension, from the standpoint of pre-emptive medicine, should include the detection of abnormal blood pressure regulation as the earliest manifestation of the disease, the depiction of the present status of hypertension in an individual (""nowcasting""), and a prediction of the future trajectory of the disease (""forecasting""). Novel therapeutic strategies for hypertension, from the standpoint of pre-emptive medicine, should aim for the regression of hypertension through early treatments and the remission of hypertension through intermittent intensive therapies. An efficient modification of lifestyle and therapies, according to the progression of hypertension, should be required.

It should be remembered that the latest count of cases is likely underestimated in real time, and moreover, the effective reproduction number, i.e. the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case at a given point in time, is also underestimated without proper adjustment. The present study aimed to adjust the reporting delay to appropriately estimate the latest incidence and obtain short-term forecasts from weekly reporting data of EVD in North Kivu, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). A semi-structured modeling approach was taken, accounting for reporting delay which can depend on time. The mean reporting delay was estimated at 11.6 days (95% CI: 11.3, 11.9) and the standard deviation was estimated to have changed from 26 November 2019 from 8.5-6.0 days. Nowcasting was successfully implemented by account for the time-dependent reporting delay: it mostly contained future observed values within the 95% confidence intervals, but there were failures when the reported incidence abruptly changed over time. Forecasting was also exercised in a similar manner to the nowcasting, while we imposed an extrapolation approach to the effective reproduction number for two future weeks. Moving average of the reproduction numbers for a few weeks prior the latest time of observation outperformed other extrapolations. The information that we can gain from real time (i.e. sequential) update of ""situation report"" can be considerably improved by integrating the proposed nowcasting and forecasting to the surveillance system.

However, the reporting of new cases is usually subject to delay due to the incubation period, time to seek care, and diagnosis. This results in a downward bias in the numbers of new cases by the times of symptoms onset towards the current day. The real-time assessment of the current situation while correcting for underreporting is called nowcasting. We present a nowcasting method based on bivariate P-spline smoothing of the number of reported cases by time of symptoms onset and delay. Our objective is to predict the number of symptomatic-but-not-yet-reported cases and combine these with the already reported symptomatic cases into a nowcast. We assume the underlying two-dimensional reporting intensity surface to be smooth. We include prior information on the reporting process as additional constraints: the smooth surface is unimodal in the reporting delay dimension, is (almost) zero at a predefined maximum delay and has a prescribed shape at the beginning of the outbreak. Parameter estimation is done efficiently by penalized iterative weighted least squares. We illustrate our method on a large measles outbreak in the Netherlands. We show that even with very limited information the method is able to accurately predict the number of symptomatic-but-not-yet-reported cases.

Accurately predicting rapid underlying lung-function decline is essential for clinical decision support and timely intervention. Determining whether an individual is experiencing a period of rapid decline is complicated due to its heterogeneous timing and extent, and error component of the measured lung function. We construct individualized predictive probabilities for ""nowcasting"" rapid decline. We assume each patient's true longitudinal lung function, S(t), follows a nonlinear, nonstationary stochastic process, and accommodate between-patient heterogeneity through random effects. Corresponding lung-function decline at time t is defined as the rate of change, S'(t). We predict S'(t) conditional on observed covariate and measurement history by modeling a measured lung function as a noisy version of S(t). The method is applied to data on 30â879 US CF Registry patients. Results are contrasted with a currently employed decision rule using single-center data on 212 individuals. Rapid decline is identified earlier using predictive probabilities than the center's currently employed decision rule (mean difference: 0.65âyears; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.41, 0.89). We constructed a bootstrapping algorithm to obtain CIs for predictive probabilities. We illustrate real-time implementation with R Shiny. Predictive accuracy is investigated using empirical simulations, which suggest this approach more accurately detects peak decline, compared with a uniform threshold of rapid decline. Median area under the ROC curve estimates (Q1-Q3) were 0.817 (0.814-0.822) and 0.745 (0.741-0.747), respectively, implying reasonable accuracy for both. This article demonstrates how individualized rate of change estimates can be coupled with probabilistic predictive inference and implementation for a useful medical-monitoring approach.

Online drinking water quality monitoring technologies have evolved substantially and have become more accurate and accessible. However, using online measurements alone is unsuitable for detecting microbial regrowth, potentially including harmful species, ahead of time in the distribution systems. Alternatively, observational data could be collected periodically, e.g. once per week or once per month and it could include a representative set of variables: physicochemical water characteristics, disinfectant concentrations, and bacterial abundances, which would be a valuable source of knowledge for predictive modelling that aims to reveal pathogen-related threats. In this study, we utilised data collected from a pilot-scale drinking water distribution system. A data-driven random forest model was used for predictive modelling and was trained for nowcasting and forecasting abundances of bacterial groups. In all the experiments, we followed the realistic crossline scenario, which means that when training and testing the models the data is collected from different pipelines. In spite of the more accurate results of the nowcasting, the 1-week forecasting still provided accurate predictions of the most abundant bacteria, their rapid increase and decrease. In the future predictive modelling might be used as a tool in designing control measures for opportunistic pathogens which are able to multiply in the favourable conditions in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS). Eventually, the forecasting information will be able to produce practically helpful data for controlling the DWDS regrowth. (Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The added value of pre-season population susceptibility data was explored.; Results: The combined results provided valuable nowcasts of the state of the epidemic. Short-term predictions of burden on primary and secondary health services were initially highly variable before reaching consensus beyond the observed peaks in activity between weeks 3-4 of 2018.
