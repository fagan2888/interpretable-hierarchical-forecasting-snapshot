Abstract = {Achieving accurate, real-time estimates of disease activity is challenged by delays in case reporting. "Nowcast" approaches attempt to estimate the complete case counts for a given reporting date, using a time series of case reports that is known to be incomplete due to reporting delays. Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmission—that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases—and are optimized to one or two applications, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to tim)},

Abstract = {Background: The ability to produce timely and accurate estimation of dengue cases can significantly impact disease control programs. A key challenge for dengue control in Thailand is the systematic delay in reporting at different levels in the surveillance system. Efficient and reliable surveillance and notification systems are vital to monitor health outcome trends and early detection of disease outbreaks which vary in space and time. Methods: Predicting the trend in dengue cases in real-time is a challenging task in Thailand due to a combination of factors including reporting delays. We present decision support using a spatiotemporal nowcasting model which accounts for reporting delays in a Bayesian framework with sliding windows. A case study is presented to demonstrate the proposed nowcasting method using weekly dengue surveillance data in Bangkok at district level in 2010. Results: The overall real-time estimation accuracy was 70.69% with 59.05% and 79.59% accuracy during low and)},

Abstract = {The ability to produce timely and accurate flu forecasts in the United States can significantly impact public health. Augmenting forecasts with internet data has shown promise for improving forecast accuracy and timeliness in controlled settings, but results in practice are less convincing, as models augmented with internet data have not consistently outperformed models without internet data. In this paper, we perform a controlled experiment, taking into account data backfill, to improve clarity on the benefits and limitations of augmenting an already good flu forecasting model with internet-based nowcasts. Our results show that a good flu forecasting model can benefit from the augmentation of internet-based nowcasts in practice for all considered public health-relevant forecasting targets. The degree of forecast improvement due to nowcasting, however, is uneven across forecasting targets, with short-term forecasting targets seeing the largest improvements and seasonal targets such as)},

Abstract = {During an infectious disease outbreak, timely information on the number of new symptomatic cases is crucial. However, the reporting of new cases is usually subject to delay due to the incubation period, time to seek care, and diagnosis. This results in a downward bias in the numbers of new cases by the times of symptoms onset towards the current day. The real-time assessment of the current situation while correcting for underreporting is called nowcasting. We present a nowcasting method based on bivariate P-spline smoothing of the number of reported cases by time of symptoms onset and delay. Our objective is to predict the number of symptomatic-but-not-yet-reported cases and combine these with the already reported symptomatic cases into a nowcast. We assume the underlying two-dimensional reporting intensity surface to be smooth. We include prior information on the reporting process as additional constraints: the smooth surface is unimodal in the reporting delay dimension, is (almost) zero at a predefined maximum delay and has a prescribed shape at the beginning of the outbreak. Parameter estimation is done efficiently by penalized iterative weighted least squares. We illustrate our method on a large measles outbreak in the Netherlands. We show that even with very limited information the method is able to accurately predict the number of symptomatic-but-not-yet-reported cases. This results in substantially improved monitoring of new symptomatic cases in real time.},

Abstract = {A variety of mechanistic and statistical methods to forecast seasonal influenza have been proposed and are in use; however, the effects of various data issues and design choices (statistical versus mechanistic methods, for example) on the accuracy of these approaches have not been thoroughly assessed. Here, we compare the accuracy of three forecasting approaches-a mechanistic method, a weighted average of two statistical methods and a super-ensemble of eight statistical and mechanistic models-in predicting seven outbreak characteristics of seasonal influenza during the 2016-2017 season at the national and 10 regional levels in the USA. For each of these approaches, we report the effects of real time under- and over-reporting in surveillance systems, use of non-surveillance proxies of influenza activity and manual override of model predictions on forecast quality. Our results suggest that a meta-ensemble of statistical and mechanistic methods has better overall accuracy than the individual methods. Supplementing surveillance data with proxy estimates generally improves the quality of forecasts and transient reporting errors degrade the performance of all three approaches considerably. The improvement in quality from ad hoc and post-forecast changes suggests that domain experts continue to possess information that is not being sufficiently captured by current forecasting approaches.

Abstract = {The growing availability of big data in healthcare and public health opens possibilities for infectious disease control in local settings. We prospectively evaluated a method for integrated local detection and prediction (nowcasting) of influenza epidemics over 5 years, using the total population in Östergötland County, Sweden. We used routine health information system data on influenza-diagnosis cases and syndromic telenursing data for July 2009-June 2014 to evaluate epidemic detection, peak-timing prediction, and peak-intensity prediction. Detection performance was satisfactory throughout the period, except for the 2011-12 influenza A(H3N2) season, which followed a season with influenza B and pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus activity. Peak-timing prediction performance was satisfactory for the 4 influenza seasons but not the pandemic. Peak-intensity levels were correctly categorized for the pandemic and 2 of 4 influenza seasons.

@article{3181611920200315,
Abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive, genetic disease characterized by frequent, prolonged drops in lung function. Accurately predicting rapid underlying lung-function decline is essential for clinical decision support and timely intervention. Determining whether an individual is experiencing a period of rapid decline is complicated due to its heterogeneous timing and extent, and error component of the measured lung function. We construct individualized predictive probabilities for "nowcasting" rapid decline. We assume each patient's true longitudinal lung function, S(t), follows a nonlinear, nonstationary stochastic process, and accommodate between-patient heterogeneity through random effects. Corresponding lung-function decline at time t is defined as the rate of change, S'(t). We predict S'(t) conditional on observed covariate and measurement history by modeling a measured lung function as a noisy version of S(t). The method is applied to data on 30 879 US CF Registry patients. Results are contrasted with a currently employed decision rule using single-center data on 212 individuals. Rapid decline is identified earlier using predictive probabilities than the center's currently employed decision rule (mean difference: 0.65 years; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.41, 0.89). We constructed a bootstrapping algorithm to obtain CIs for predictive probabilities. We illustrate real-time implementation with R Shiny. Predictive accuracy is investigated using empirical simulations, which suggest this approach more accurately detects peak decline, compared with a uniform threshold of rapid decline. Median area under the ROC curve estimates (Q1-Q3) were 0.817 (0.814-0.822) and 0.745 (0.741-0.747), respectively, implying reasonable accuracy for both. This article demonstrates how individualized rate of change estimates can be coupled with probabilistic predictive inference and implementation for a useful medical-monitoring approach.

Abstract = {Background: Since the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic, Public Health England have developed a suite of real-time statistical models utilising enhanced pandemic surveillance data to nowcast and forecast a future pandemic. Their ability to track seasonal influenza and predict heightened winter healthcare burden in the light of high activity in Australia in 2017 was untested.; Methods: Four transmission models were used in forecasting the 2017/2018 seasonal influenza epidemic in England: a stratified primary care model using daily, region-specific, counts and virological swab positivity of influenza-like illness consultations in general practice (GP); a strain-specific (SS) model using weekly, national GP ILI and virological data; an intensive care model (ICU) using reports of ICU influenza admissions; and a synthesis model that included all data sources. For the first 12 weeks of 2018, each model was applied to the latest data to provide estimates of epidemic parameters and short-term influenza forecasts. The added value of pre-season population susceptibility data was explored.; Results: The combined results provided valuable nowcasts of the state of the epidemic. Short-term predictions of burden on primary and secondary health services were initially highly variable before reaching consensus beyond the observed peaks in activity between weeks 3-4 of 2018. Estimates for R 0 were consistent over time for three of the four models until week 12 of 2018, and there was consistency in the estimation of R 0 across the SPC and SS models, and in the ICU attack rates estimated by the ICU and the synthesis model. Estimation and predictions varied according to the assumed levels of pre-season immunity.; Conclusions: This exercise successfully applied a range of pandemic models to seasonal influenza. Forecasting early in the season remains challenging but represents a crucially important activity to inform planning. Improved knowledge of pre-existing levels of immunity would be valuable.},

As of May 16, 55,992 cases had been reported and the outbreak was still spreading. Identification of newly affected locations is paramount to intervention activities, but challenging due to limitations of current data on the outbreak and on CHIKV transmission. We developed models to make probabilistic predictions of spread based on current data considering these limitations. Methods and Findings: Branching process models capturing travel patterns, local infection prevalence, climate dependent transmission factors, and associated uncertainty estimates were developed to predict probable locations for the arrival of CHIKV-infected travelers and for the initiation of local transmission.

Abstract = {A Bayesian approach to the prediction of occurred-but-not-yet-reported events is developed for application in real-time public health surveillance. The motivation was the prediction of the daily number of hospitalizations for the hemolytic-uremic syndrome during the large May-July 2011 outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O104:H4 in Germany. Our novel Bayesian approach addresses the count data nature of the problem using negative binomial sampling and shows that right-truncation of the reporting delay distribution under an assumption of time-homogeneity can be handled in a conjugate prior-posterior framework using the generalized Dirichlet distribution. Since, in retrospect, the true number of hospitalizations is available, proper scoring rules for count data are used to evaluate and compare the predictive quality of the procedures during the outbreak. The results show that it is important to take the count nature of the time series into account and that changes i)},

Abstract = {Foodborne diseases have a big impact on public health and are often underreported. This is because a lot of patients delay treatment when they suffer from foodborne diseases. In Hunan Province (China), a total of 21,226 confirmed foodborne disease cases were reported from 1 March 2015 to 28 February 2016 by the Foodborne Surveillance Database (FSD) of the China National Centre for Food Safety Risk Assessment (CFSA). The purpose of this study was to make use of the daily number of visiting patients to forecast the daily true number of patients. Our main contribution is that we take the reporting delays into consideration and propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for this forecast problem. The data shows that there were 21,226 confirmed cases reported among 21,866 visiting patients, a proportion as high as 97%. Given this observation, the Bayesian hierarchical model was established to predict the daily true number of patients using the number of visiting patients. We propose several scoring rules to assess the performance of different nowcasting procedures. We conclude that Bayesian nowcasting with consideration of right truncation of the reporting delays has a good performance for short-term forecasting, and could effectively predict the epidemic trends of foodborne diseases. Meanwhile, this approach could provide a methodological basis for future foodborne disease monitoring and control strategies, which are crucial for public health.},

Abstract = {Waterborne disease outbreaks are a persistent and serious threat to public health according to reported incidents across the globe. Online drinking water quality monitoring technologies have evolved substantially and have become more accurate and accessible. However, using online measurements alone is unsuitable for detecting microbial regrowth, potentially including harmful species, ahead of time in the distribution systems. Alternatively, observational data could be collected periodically, e.g. once per week or once per month and it could include a representative set of variables: physicochemical water characteristics, disinfectant concentrations, and bacterial abundances, which would be a valuable source of knowledge for predictive modelling that aims to reveal pathogen-related threats. In this study, we utilised data collected from a pilot-scale drinking water distribution system. A data-driven random forest model was used for predictive modelling and was trained for nowcasting and forecasting abundances of bacterial groups. In all the experiments, we followed the realistic crossline scenario, which means that when training and testing the models the data is collected from different pipelines. In spite of the more accurate results of the nowcasting, the 1-week forecasting still provided accurate predictions of the most abundant bacteria, their rapid increase and decrease. In the future predictive modelling might be used as a tool in designing control measures for opportunistic pathogens which are able to multiply in the favourable conditions in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS). Eventually, the forecasting information will be able to produce practically helpful data for controlling the DWDS regrowth. (Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.)},

Monitoring and forecasting the evolution of these outbreaks supports decision makers in designing effective interventions and allocating resources to mitigate their impact.; Objective: Describe the existing participatory surveillance approaches that have been used for modeling and forecasting of the seasonal influenza epidemic, and how they can help strengthen real-time epidemic science and provide a more rigorous understanding of epidemic conditions.; Methods: We describe three different participatory surveillance systems, WISDM (Widely Internet Sourced Distributed Monitoring), Influenzanet and Flu Near You (FNY), and show how modeling and simulation can be or has been combined with participatory disease surveillance to: i) measure the non-response bias in a participatory surveillance sample using WISDM; and ii) nowcast and forecast influenza activity in different parts of the world (using Influenzanet and Flu Near You).; Results: WISDM-based results measure the participatory and sample bias for three epidemic metrics i.e. attack rate, peak infection rate, and time-to-peak, and find the participatory bias to be the largest component of the total bias. The Influenzanet platform shows that digital participatory surveillance data combined with a realistic data-driven epidemiological model can provide both short-term and long-term forecasts of epidemic intensities, and the ground truth data lie within the 95 percent confidence intervals for most weeks. The statistical accuracy of the ensemble forecasts increase as the season progresses. The Flu Near You platform shows that participatory surveillance data provide accurate short-term flu activity forecasts and influenza activity predictions. The correlation of the HealthMap Flu Trends estimates with the observed CDC ILI rates is 0.99 for 2013-2015. Additional data sources lead to an error reduction of about 40% when compared to the estimates of the model that only incorporates CDC historical information.; Conclusions: While the advantages of participatory surveillance, compared to traditional surveillance, include its timeliness, lower costs, and broader reach, it is limited by a lack of control over the characteristics of the population sample. Modeling and simulation can help overcome this limitation as well as provide real-time and long-term forecasting of influenza activity in data-poor parts of the world.

Abstract = {Fecal indicator bacteria like Escherichia coli and entercococci are monitored at beaches around the world to reduce incidence of recreational waterborne illness. Measurements are usually made weekly, but FIB concentrations can exhibit extreme variability, fluctuating at shorter periods. The result is that water quality has likely changed by the time data are provided to beachgoers. Here, we present an automated water quality prediction system (called the nowcast system) that is capable of providing daily predictions of water quality for numerous beaches. We created nowcast models for 10 California beaches using weather, oceanographic, and other environmental variables as input to tuned regression models to predict if FIB concentrations were above single sample water quality standards. Rainfall was used as a variable in nearly every model. The models were calibrated and validated using historical data. Subsequently, models were implemented during the 2017 swim season in collaboration with local beach managers. During the 2017 swim season, the median sensitivity of the nowcast models was 0.5 compared to 0 for the current method of using day-to-week old measurements to make beach posting decisions. Model specificity was also high (median of 0.87). During the implementation phase, nowcast models provided an average of 140 additional days per beach of updated water quality information to managers when water quality measurements were not made. The work presented herein emphasizes that a one-size-fits all approach to nowcast modeling, even when beaches are in close proximity, is infeasible. Flexibility in modeling approaches and adaptive responses to modeling and data challenges are required when implementing nowcast models for beach management. (Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Microbial contamination in beach water poses a public health threat due to waterborne diseases. To reduce the risk of exposure to fecal contamination, informing beachgoers in advance about the microbial water quality is important. Currently, determining the level of fecal contamination takes 24 h. The objective of this study is to predict the current level of fecal contamination (enterococcus [ENT] and ) using readily available environmental variables. Artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) models were constructed using data from the Haeundae and Gwangalli Beaches in Busan City. The input variables included the tidal level, air and water temperature, solar radiation, wind direction and velocity, precipitation, discharge from the wastewater treatment plant, and suspended solid concentration in beach water. The dependence of fecal contamination on the input variables was statistically evaluated; precipitation, discharge from the wastewater treatment plant, and wind direction at the two beaches were positively correlated to the changes in the two bacterial concentrations ( < 0.01), whereas solar radiation was negatively correlated ( < 0.01). The performance of the ANN model for predicting ENT and at Gwangalli Beach was significantly higher than that of the SVR model with the training dataset ( < 0.05). Based on the comparison of residual values between the predicted and observed fecal indicator bacteria concentrations in two models, the ANN demonstrated better performance than SVR. This study suggests an effective prediction method to determine whether a beach is safe for recreational use.

Abstract = {Timeliness of a public health surveillance system is one of its most important characteristics. The process of predicting the present situation using available incomplete information from surveillance systems has received the term nowcasting and has high public health interest. Generally in Europe, general practitioners' sentinel networks support the epidemiological surveillance of influenza activity, and each week's epidemiological bulletins are usually issued between Wednesday and Friday of the following week. In this work, we have developed a non-homogeneous hidden Markov model (HMM) that, on a weekly basis, uses as covariates an early observation of influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence rate and the number of ILI cases tested positive to nowcast the current week ILI rate and the probability that the influenza activity is in an epidemic state. We use Bayesian inference to find estimates of the model parameters and nowcasted quantities. The results obtained with data provided by the Portuguese influenza surveillance system show the additional value of using a non-homogeneous HMM instead of a homogeneous one. The use of a non-homogeneous HMM improves the surveillance system timeliness in 2 weeks. (Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.)},

Abstract = {During an Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, the analysis and forecasting of the incidence in real time is challenged by reporting of cases, especially the reporting delay. It should be remembered that the latest count of cases is likely underestimated in real time, and moreover, the effective reproduction number, i.e. the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case at a given point in time, is also underestimated without proper adjustment. The present study aimed to adjust the reporting delay to appropriately estimate the latest incidence and obtain short-term forecasts from weekly reporting data of EVD in North Kivu, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). A semi-structured modeling approach was taken, accounting for reporting delay which can depend on time. The mean reporting delay was estimated at 11.6 days (95% CI: 11.3, 11.9) and the standard deviation was estimated to have changed from 26 November 2019 from 8.5-6.0 days. Nowcasting was successfully implemented by account for the time-dependent reporting delay: it mostly contained future observed values within the 95% confidence intervals, but there were failures when the reported incidence abruptly changed over time. Forecasting was also exercised in a similar manner to the nowcasting, while we imposed an extrapolation approach to the effective reproduction number for two future weeks. Moving average of the reproduction numbers for a few weeks prior the latest time of observation outperformed other extrapolations. The information that we can gain from real time (i.e. sequential) update of "situation report" can be considerably improved by integrating the proposed nowcasting and forecasting to the surveillance system.

Abstract = {Pre-emptive medicine is a novel medical concept proposed in Japan that aims to precisely predict the onset and progression of diseases and to provide therapeutic interventions during early stages, before symptoms appear. The concept of pre-emptive medicine considers the time-course of a disease in each individual and seeks medical interventions to prevent disease progression. Suitable and promising targets for pre-emptive medicine are non-communicable diseases, including hypertension. Recent advances in genomic analysis, information technology, and artificial intelligence should make this medical concept feasible in the near future. In this review, we focused on pre-emptive medicine for hypertension, referring to concrete plans for the future direction of this research. The ultimate goal of pre-emptive medicine is to completely prevent the onset and progression of hypertension by precisely predicting the elevation of blood pressure and performing interventions to avoid it. The diagnostic processes of hypertension, from the standpoint of pre-emptive medicine, should include the detection of abnormal blood pressure regulation as the earliest manifestation of the disease, the depiction of the present status of hypertension in an individual ("nowcasting"), and a prediction of the future trajectory of the disease ("forecasting"). Novel therapeutic strategies for hypertension, from the standpoint of pre-emptive medicine, should aim for the regression of hypertension through early treatments and the remission of hypertension through intermittent intensive therapies. An efficient modification of lifestyle and therapies, according to the progression of hypertension, should be required. If pre-emptive medicine for hypertension becomes established, it would greatly contribute to the extension of a healthy lifespan, which cannot yet be satisfactorily achieved.},

Abstract = {Aim: To assess the quality of and to critically synthesize the available data on hepatitis C infections in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to map evidence gaps.; Methods: We conducted an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) following an a priori developed protocol (CRD42017076736). Our overview followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines for reporting SRs and abstracts and did not receive any funding. Two independent reviewers systematically searched MEDLINE and conducted a multistage screening of the identified articles. Out of 5758 identified articles, 37 SRs of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in populations living in 20 countries in the MENA region published between 2008 and 2016 were included in our overview. The nine primary outcomes of interest were HCV antibody (anti-) prevalences and incidences in different at-risk populations; the HCV viremic (RNA positive) rate in HCV-positive individuals; HCV viremic prevalence in the general population (GP); the prevalence of HCV co-infection with the hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, or schistosomiasis; the HCV genotype/subtype distribution; and the risk factors for HCV transmission. The conflicts of interest declared by the authors of the SRs were also extracted. Good quality outcomes reported by the SRs were defined as having the population, outcome, study time and setting defined as recommended by the PICOTS framework and a sample size > 100.; Results: We included SRs reporting HCV outcomes with different levels of quality and precision. A substantial proportion of them synthesized data from mixed populations at differing levels of risk for acquiring HCV or at different HCV infection stages (recent and prior HCV transmissions). They also synthesized the data over long periods of time ( e.g ., two decades). Anti-HCV prevalence in the GP varied widely in the MENA region from 0.1% (study dates not reported) in the United Arab Emirates to 2.1%-13.5% (2003-2006) in Pakistan and 14.7% (2008) in Egypt. Data were not identified for Bahrain, Jordan, or Palestine. Good quality estimates of anti-HCV prevalence in the GP were reported for Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Pakistan, Syria, Sudan, Tunisia, and Yemen. Anti-HCV incidence estimates in the GP were reported only for Egypt (0.8-6.8 per 1000 person-year, 1997-2003). In Egypt, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates, viremic rates in anti-HCV-positive individuals from the GP were approximately 70%. In the GP, the viremic prevalence varied from 0.7% (2011) in Saudi Arabia to 5.8% (2007-2008) in Pakistan and 10.0% (2008) in Egypt. Anti-HCV prevalence was lower in blood donors than in the GP, ranging from 0.2% (1992-1993) in Algeria to 1.7% (2005) in Yemen. The reporting quality of the outcomes in blood donors was good in the MENA countries, except in Qatar where no time framework was reported for the outcome. Some countries had anti-HCV prevalence estimates for children, transfused patients, contacts of HCV-infected patients, prisoners, sex workers, and men who have sex with men.; Conclusion: A substantial proportion of the reported outcomes may not help policymakers to develop micro-elimination strategies with precise HCV infection prevention and treatment programs in the region, as nowcasting HCV epidemiology using these data is potentially difficult. In addition to providing accurate information on HCV epidemiology, outcomes should also demonstrate practical and clinical significance and relevance. Based on the available data, most countries in the region have low to moderate anti-HCV prevalence. To achieve HCV elimination by 2030, up-to-date, good quality data on HCV epidemiology are required for the GP and key populations such as people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men.},

Estimates from transmission model were higher but overlapped with these. Personal protection and rapid confirmation of cases were identified as the most important countermeasures.; Conclusions: Our estimates were in agreement with others from the ROK outbreak, albeit significantly higher than estimates based on other small outbreaks and sporadic cases of MERS-CoV. The large-scale outbreak in the ROK was jointly due to the high transmissibility in the healthcare-associated setting and the Korean culture-associated contact behaviour. Limiting such behaviour by rapidly identifying and isolating cases and avoiding high-risk contacts effectively stopped further transmission. (© 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {The winter climate of the British Isles is characterized by considerable interannual variability, which, because of the general climate sensitivity of a number of health outcomes, places at times considerable pressure on the provision of health services. Seasonal climate forecasts potentially could improve management within the health sector and assist in hedging against the vagaries of climatic variability. For this reason, an exploratory analysis of the potential utility of seasonal climate forecasting for the health sector in the United Kingdom is presented here. Study results revealed that the general level of winter mortality at the monthly to seasonal time scale possesses a strong association with simple descriptors of winter climate such as maximum temperature and the number of days below a given temperature threshold. Because such climate indices can be derived from the output of coupled seasonal climate prediction models, predictions of general levels of mortality may be poss)},

Abstract = {Epidemiological studies indicate that fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in beach water are associated with illnesses among people having contact with the water. In order to mitigate public health impacts, many beaches are posted with an advisory when the concentration of FIB exceeds a beach action value. The most commonly used method of measuring FIB concentration takes 18–24 h before returning a result. In order to avoid the 24 h lag, it has become common to ”nowcast” the FIB concentration using statistical regressions on environmental surrogate variables. Most commonly, nowcast models are estimated using ordinary least squares regression, but other regression methods from the statistical and machine learning literature are sometimes used. This study compares 14 regression methods across 7 Wisconsin beaches to identify which consistently produces the most accurate predictions. A random forest model is identified as the most accurate, followed by multiple regression fit using the adaptiv)},

Abstract = {Background A Heat-Health Watch system has been established in England and Wales since 2004 as part of the national heatwave plan following the 2003 Europeanwide heatwave. One important element of this plan has been the development of a timely mortality surveillance system. This article reports the findings and timeliness of a daily mortality model used to 'nowcast' excess mortality (utilising incomplete surveillance data to estimate the number of deaths in near-real time) during a heatwave alert issued by the Met Office for regions in South and East England on 24 June 2011.

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, global metapopulation epidemic simulations built with worldwide air-transportation data have been the main tool for studying how epidemics spread from the origin to other parts of the world (e.g., for pandemic influenza, SARS, and Ebola). However, it remains unclear how disease epidemiology and the air-transportation network structure determine epidemic arrivals for different populations around the globe. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by developing and validating an analytical framework that requires only basic analytics from stochastic processes. We apply this framework retrospectively to the 2009 influenza pandemic and 2014 Ebola epidemic to show that key epidemic parameters could be robustly estimated in real-time from public data on local and global spread at very low computational cost. Our framework not only elucidates the dynamics underlying global spread of epidemics but also advances our capability in nowcasting and forecasting epidemics.},

Abstract = {Background: A Heat-Health Watch system has been established in England and Wales since 2004 as part of the national heatwave plan following the 2003 European-wide heatwave. One important element of this plan has been the development of a timely mortality surveillance system. This article reports the findings and timeliness of a daily mortality model used to 'nowcast' excess mortality (utilising incomplete surveillance data to estimate the number of deaths in near-real time) during a heatwave alert issued by the Met Office for regions in South and East England on 24 June 2011.; Methods: Daily death registrations were corrected for reporting delays with historical data supplied by the General Registry Office. These corrected counts were compared with expected counts from an age-specific linear regression model to ascertain if any excess had occurred during the heatwave.; Results: Excess mortality of 367 deaths was detected across England and Wales in ≥85-year-olds on 26 and 27 June 2011, coinciding with the period of elevated temperature. This excess was localised to the east of England and London. It was detected 3 days after the heatwave.; Conclusion: A daily mortality model was sensitive and timely enough to rapidly detect a small excess, both, at national and regional levels. This tool will be useful when future events of public health significance occur.},

Abstract = {During emerging epidemics of infectious diseases, it is vital to have up-to-date information on epidemic trends, such as incidence or health care demand, because hospitals and intensive care units have limited excess capacity. However, real-time tracking of epidemics is difficult, because of the inherent delay between onset of symptoms or hospitalizations, and reporting. We propose a robust algorithm to correct for reporting delays, using the observed distribution of reporting delays. We apply the algorithm to pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 hospitalizations as reported in the Netherlands. We show that the proposed algorithm is able to provide unbiased predictions of the actual number of hospitalizations in real-time during the ascent and descent of the epidemic. The real-time predictions of admissions are useful to adjust planning in hospitals to avoid exceeding their capacity.},
