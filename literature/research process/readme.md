# Literature Research Process

In line with the recommendations by ([vom Brocke et al., 2009](https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2009/161/)) for rigor in the literature review process, the literature search and title and abstract scanning phase is documented with the goal of maximum reproducability. Database search results are fully stored as bibtex files and enriched with meta-information about the search (e.g. date, keywords, inclusion criteria). Each publication found is evaluated against the inclusion criterion and marked as accepted or discarded respectively, together with a short comment reasoning.

The enriched bibtex files are automatically processed into summaries of the research in markdown format and merged with other database search results for the same research topic to identify duplicates. The full procedure is implemented in [this notebook](./evaluate_scan.ipynb).
